# Langchain-based Chat Bot

Welcome to the repository for a dynamic Chat Bot, utilizing the power of Langchain, OpenAI's GPT models, and Gradio interface to deliver an engaging conversational experience.

## About the Technologies

**Langchain:** A framework designed to make working with language models more accessible and more potent. It streamlines integrating these models into applications for enhanced conversational capabilities.

**OpenAI GPT:** The latest in cutting-edge AI for natural language processing. OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer models are known for their ability to understand and generate human-like text, forming the backbone of our Chat Bot's intelligence.

**Gradio:** An easy-to-use library to create customizable UI components for machine learning models. With Gradio, we provide an interactive interface for users to communicate with the Chat Bot.

## Repository Structure

- `Process_files.py`: This script is responsible for parsing knowledge resources and building the database that the Chat Bot will use to retrieve information and learn from.

- `Chatbot.py`: The main script that launches the Chat Bot. It includes the logic of the bot and sets up the Gradio interface to allow for real-time user interaction.

- `Resources`: This directory is designated for storing the resource files which the bot will use as its knowledge base.

For more details on each file, please refer to the comments within the scripts which explain the specifics of the code and its functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Chat Bot, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can run the `Chatbot.py` script to start interacting with the Chat Bot through the Gradio interface.
